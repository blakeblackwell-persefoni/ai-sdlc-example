# Agentic SDLC Example

An experimental repository exploring the future of software development through an **Agentic Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.

## What is Agentic SDLC?

Traditional software development follows a human-driven lifecycle: requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. An **Agentic SDLC** reimagines this process with AI agents as active collaborators—or even primary drivers—at each stage.

Rather than AI serving as a passive code completion tool, an agentic approach treats AI as a capable partner that can:

- **Understand context** across the entire codebase and project history
- **Make decisions** about architecture, implementation patterns, and trade-offs
- **Execute tasks** end-to-end with minimal human intervention
- **Iterate autonomously** based on feedback, tests, and requirements
- **Collaborate** with humans at strategic decision points

## Goals of This Repository

This project serves as a living experiment to explore:

1. **AI-First Development** — How far can we push AI agency in building real software?
2. **Human-AI Collaboration Patterns** — What's the optimal division of labor?
3. **Quality & Reliability** — Can agentic development produce production-grade code?
4. **Process Innovation** — What new workflows emerge when AI is a first-class participant?

## The Experiment

This repository will be developed primarily through agentic AI interactions, with human oversight focused on:

- Setting high-level goals and requirements
- Reviewing and approving significant decisions
- Course-correcting when needed
- Documenting learnings and patterns

Everything from feature implementation to testing, documentation, and even repository management will be handled by AI agents where possible.

## Follow Along

Watch the commit history and discussions to see agentic development in action. Each commit tells a story of human-AI collaboration pushing the boundaries of what's possible in modern software development.
